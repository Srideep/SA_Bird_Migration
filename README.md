Geospatial analysis on purple martins migration patterns in South America

#  Introduction

This project involves analysis bird conservation and understing of migration patterns of purple martins in North/South America. In this research,  it was discovered that these birds typically spend the summer breeding season in the eastern United States, and then migrate to South America for the winter.  But since this bird is under threat of endangerment, we took a closer look at the locations that these birds are more likely to visit.

There are several [protected areas](https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/about) in South America, which operate under special regulations to ensure that species that migrate (or live) there have the best opportunity to thrive. Knowing the location if purple martins tend to visit these areas is a subject of my interest.  To answer this question, I use some recently collected data that tracks the year-round location of eleven different birds.
